The code provided is set to run for Dense Graph (G2), to run it on Sparse Graph (G1), change "createG2()" on "line #742" to "createG1()" to change the Graph type to G1



Each iteration generates output for 5 source-to-destination pairs in a graph, by all the 3 algorithms.



The output countains - 

Maximum Bandwidth for every source-to-destination pair, 

Maximum Bandwidth Path for every source-to-destination pair
At the end of all the iterations it will give the time taken by each algorithm for every source-to-destination pair

Average time taken by each algorithm.



If you want to generate multiple outputs increase the number of iterations by changing the value of variable "noOfIterations" on line #740 -- but it is recommended to run one iteration only because the result is more readable that way.
